<h1>Welcome to my life...</h1>

<div class="b1"><p>My name is Vince Edward Garcia Tagudar. I was born and raised in Baguio City. 
    I'm currently taking up the course BSIT in Saint Louis University. I think of myself as an outgoing person but at the same time, I don't want to mingle with other people. I currently live with both my parents and my brother. I'm the youngest in our household. My dream was always to be 
    a soldier but due to my poor eyesight, I gave up on that dream. Then I took BSIT just because I want to be someone 
    who helps in making games that people will love. I thought if I was good at computer games, this course will be easy...

<h3 class="wrong"><b>I WAS WRONG</b></h3>
<div class="b2"><p>This course is difficult to accomplish without the right mindset. I learned that the hard way. Though I am still learning, 
    I want to finish this semester with the right attitude towards the course to finally finish college. My dream is to give my parents the best life I can provide for them. I want to repay all their sacrifices with life with little to 
    no worries.
