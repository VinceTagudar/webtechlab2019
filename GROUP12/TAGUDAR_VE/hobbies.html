    I really enjoy playing video games with my friends. I also enjoy playing outdoor sports especially basketball. 
    Basically, I enjoy the company of my peers. One of the things we do as a group is to go to bars or travel spontaneously. 
    We have so much fun drinking or just talking and telling each other stories. This is the kind of group I wish that I'll have 
    until the very end.

    But if I'm alone, I usually watch movies or series on the computer. 
    This helps me relax when I'm fed up with stress. I watch a lot of romcoms and horror titles. I also like 
    superhero movies and tend to invite my friends to movie marathons. But when I want to go out on my own, I like going to 
    the gym and sweat all my troubles away and exercise my body. Fitness is and always will be a priority for me but I 
    keep on having a hard time with diet because I love to eat delicious food.

    I also play some instruments but the main instrument I play is the guitar. 
    This goes without saying that I really enjoy listening to all kinds of musical genres.
